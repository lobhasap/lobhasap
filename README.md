👋 Heyo! I’m @lobhasap   

👀 Currently vibing with: Coding things that may or may not crash my computer, building apps no one asked for, and staying ahead in the tech game.

🌱 In the lab, cooking up: AI magic, full-stack wizardry, and trying not to break the internet with my next deployment.

💞️ Let’s make something epic: If it involves cool tech, creative chaos, or giving GPT all the credit for my next breakthrough—I'm in.

📫 Slide into my inbox: lobhasap@gmial.com or stalk me on LinkedIn (no shame).

😄 Pronouns: He/Him (but my code? It identifies as an eternal WIP).

⚡ Fun fact: I write code like I live my life—add a bit of chaos, a dash of caffeine, and let GPT-4 handle the hard parts. 🤖💡

“I swear I had an original idea... until GPT-4 wrote it better.” – Me, every day.
